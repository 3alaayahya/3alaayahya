👋 Hi, I’m Alaa Yehya!

👀 I’m passionate about Full Stack Development, with a strong focus on backend technologies and databases.

💻 My expertise includes:

Backend: SQL, MongoDB, C#, Java

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native

Cloud & DevOps: AWS (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, MongoDB Atlas, and more)

✅ I’ve completed my final BSc project in Computer Science, where I built a full-stack system using React (web frontend), React Native (mobile app), and C# ASP.NET (backend). The project, called Sportify, included an AI-powered recommendation system and a well-structured SQL database. This experience gave me strong, hands-on skills in building both web and mobile applications from the ground up.

💼 I’m actively seeking a Junior Full Stack Developer or QA Tester position, where I can grow, contribute, and build impactful software solutions.

💞️ I’m excited to collaborate on innovative projects that blend creativity, performance, and user-focused design.
